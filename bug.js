This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR). The error message might vary, but it usually indicates that Tailwind's directives or classes aren't being applied correctly during the server-side rendering process. This can happen if Tailwind's configuration or setup isn't properly configured for SSR, leading to missing styles or runtime errors in the browser.
